## Description

This project was built using a starter template which had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. This project was converted from a static project to an interactive one with minimal modification of the HTML and CSS files, and complete authoring of the JS file.

The project is a multi-section landing page where the navigation is dynamically built according to how many `section` elements there are on the page. The section currently being viewed is styled according to scroll position, as well as the associated navigation link.
